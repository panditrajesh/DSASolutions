# DSASolutions
This repository holds solution of some important coding problems
<br>
I thought to create this repository to collect the problems in one place, which I'm solving during my preparation. It would be a future reference as well and it probably may help someone.
<br>
1. Linear search 
2. Length of the longest subarray with sum equal to k
3. Maximum subarray sum : KADANE'S ALGORITHM
4. Longest consecutive sequence
